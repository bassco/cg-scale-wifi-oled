**Features**
- recent ESP32 wifi-bluetooth-oled board, mainstream and low cost (sub $10)
- designed with small and minimal 3d printing
- foldable
- manage from a parkflyer, 1m DLG to bigger aerobatic motorised planes (and tunable), and of course F3X gliders!
- full remote control, configuration and monitoring via Wifi
- precise tuning and tare
- save configuration in the ESP32 flash memory
- standalone display with the ESP32 oled
- works with a simple 1S lipo
- multi-language design, (included: english, french)

The scale 3d parts are parametric and designed with openscad. You can edit the SCAD file and regenerate the STL.
