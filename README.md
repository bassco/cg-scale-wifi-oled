# cg-scale-wifi-oled

Yet another Olkal design iteration with some refresh.

I needed a cg scale with minimal part printing, foldable and able to manage from a 1m DLG to bigger aerobatic motorised.
The scale is completely redesigned with openscad, allowing to modify it if needed.
Development from scratch of the software, around an ESP32 oled:
 * wifi allowing a fast (re)configuration of the scale
 * wifi and oled allowing the live monitoring
