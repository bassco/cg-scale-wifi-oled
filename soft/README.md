1) download/install the latest Arduino.cc IDE.

2) in the File > Preferences window in the IDE paste the following line into the Additional Boards Manager URL:

https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json

3) go to Tools > Board > Board Manager

4) type ESP32 and Install the new hardware libraries

5) you will be able to find all the ESP32 boards including the Heltec Wifi 32 in the IDEâ€™s board selector:
     "ESP32 Dev Module"

6) go to Tools > Manage Libraries. Search and install those:
     "ESP8266 and ESP32 Oled Driver for SSD1306 display"

You are set to compile the 'cgscale.ino' file and flash the board.


Under linux, you can run my Makefile (`make`) to compile and flash to the board.
